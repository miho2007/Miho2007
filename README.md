## 💾 Who am I?
I’m a young programmer who enjoys creating things — building my own small worlds on the internet.

Mastering technologies like Python, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, React, Angular, C#, and other tools allows me to fully use my creativity and bring ideas to life.

I’m currently based in Tbilisi, Georgia, studying for my Bachelor’s degree at BTU (Business and Technology University).

My goal is to keep learning, growing, and eventually find myself on the frontier of the future.

  <summary><h3>codelaxy</h3></summary>

  Codelaxy is a coding challenge platform prototype that combines a Python CLI tool with a web-based hexagon map.
Players solve programming problems locally, run automated tests, submit their solutions, and capture hexagons on a shared map when their solution passes.

The project blends competitive programming, game mechanics, and Git-based synchronization — without requiring a backend server.

## 🧠 Core Idea

- Solve coding problems → gain territory  
- Harder problems → stronger control  
- Git acts as the synchronization layer  
- The website visualizes the global game state  

Think: **competitive programming + territory control**.

  <summary><h3>About my coding journey</h3></summary>

  It all started at school, where I was introduced to a little bit of HTML and CSS. I built very simple things back then and never really thought about programming seriously.

  Everything changed when my father bought me an Arduino. That’s where things got real. Working with hardware sparked my interest, and during the COVID pandemic I decided to continue down that path.

  After that, I started learning Python and created my first real project — IP_tool (you can find it here on my GitHub). To upload that project, I created this GitHub account, and on April 4, 2022, things          officially got serious.

  Since then, I’ve been constantly learning and building. I completed CS50P and started a 2-year course at IT Academy Step Georgia, where I studied:

  - HTML, CSS, JavaScript

  - Angular

  - SQL

  - C# and .NET backend development

  - Unity game development with C#

  Later, I got into Business and Technology University in Tbilisi, where I’m currently studying.

  Right now, my main goal is simple:
  to keep learning, keep building, and work on more interesting and challenging projects.

  This GitHub reflects that journey 🚀
